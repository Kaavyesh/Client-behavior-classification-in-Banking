# Client-behavior-classification-in-Banking
This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to classify and understand client behavior in the banking sector. The aim is to categorize and analyze the behavior of clients, enabling banks to make more informed decisions about whom to provide banking facilities and what credit limits to offer. 

Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains the following columns:
age: Represents the age of the individual.

job: Indicates the occupation or job of the individual.

marital: Describes the marital status of the individual (e.g., married, single, divorced).

education: Specifies the educational level or qualification of the individual.

default: Indicates whether the individual has credit in default (yes/no).

housing: Shows whether the individual has a housing loan (yes/no).

loan: Represents whether the individual has a personal loan (yes/no).

contact: Specifies the type of communication used to contact the individual (e.g., cellular, telephone).

month: Indicates the last contact month of the year.

day_of_week: Specifies the last contact day of the week.

duration: Represents the duration of the last contact in seconds.

campaign: Indicates the number of contacts performed during this campaign.

pdays: Describes the number of days since the individual was last contacted.

previous: Specifies the number of contacts performed before this campaign.

poutcome: Represents the outcome of the previous marketing campaign.

emp.var.rate: Indicates the employment variation rate.

cons.price.idx: Describes the consumer price index.

cons.conf.idx: Represents the consumer confidence index.

euribor3m: Specifies the Euribor 3-month rate.

nr.employed: Indicates the number of employees.

y: This column is a target variable, where 'yes' and 'no' indicate the outcome of interest.

#Analysis Steps
The project involves the following key steps:

Data Preprocessing and Feature Selection Steps:
Data Loading and Exploration:

Data is loaded from Google Drive using Google Colab.
Basic data exploration is performed, including checking data dimensions, data types, missing values, and duplicates.
Data Encoding:

Categorical features are transformed into numerical values using techniques like Ordinal Encoder and Label Encoder.
Feature Scaling:

Numerical features are scaled using Min-Max scaling to bring them within a range of 0 to 1.
Feature Selection:

Feature selection is crucial for model performance. Various techniques are applied:
Chi-Squared Statistic: SelectKBest is used to select the top features with high chi-squared scores.
Mutual Information Statistic: SelectKBest is used to select features with high mutual information scores.
Feature Importance using Tree Classifier: An Extra Trees Classifier is used to determine feature importances.
Feature Correlation Analysis:

Feature correlation is analyzed using a heatmap to detect multicollinearity among features.
Model Preparation:

Data is divided into training and testing sets for machine learning model training and evaluation.
Classification Models:

Although not provided in the code, this is typically where you would build and train classification models.
Print Model Information:

The code displays information about the shapes of training and testing data.
